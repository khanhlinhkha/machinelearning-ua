# AXA Data Science Challenge 2023

This repository contains our team's submission for the **AXA Data Science Challenge 2023**, organized by AXA Belgium and the University of Antwerp. The challenge focused on developing a predictive model to estimate the probability of a car insurance offer being converted into a signed contract.

> This project was completed as part of the **Machine Learning** course at the **University of Antwerp**.  
> **Winner team out of 50 teams** in the AXA Data Science Challenge 2023.

## Objective

Build a machine learning model that maximizes **AUC** on a real-world dataset of car insurance offers, using customer, car, and broker-related features.

## Repository Structure

- `final_version_preprocess.py` â€“ Preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and transforming the training and test data.
- `final_version_models.py` â€“ Script for training and evaluating multiple machine learning models.
- `final_version_scoring.py` â€“ Applies the trained model to the test set and outputs prediction scores for submission.

> âš **Note:** Raw data files and the final report are **not included** in this repository due to confidentiality agreements. Code files do not contain any confidential information.

## Key Features

- End-to-end machine learning pipeline: from preprocessing to prediction.
- Comparison and evaluation of multiple models using **AUC**.
- Business-relevant insights and explainable AI techniques.

## ðŸ“œ License & Confidentiality

This project is subject to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with AXA Belgium. As such, **raw datasets and the final project report are excluded** to protect confidential information.
